In due course full description of usage will appear here.

The code is written in Python3 and requires GPU computing machine for achieving reasonable performance.

## Try how it works in google colaboratory:

[Train your own Deep Learning Language Models and embed our tweets in Google colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1K-XQJnauYvULdwUO3vELy9dJ1DHR_53b) </br>
Select the runtime type Python3 with GPU acceleration for reasonable performance.

[Carry out Machine Learning classification of sentiment in Google colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/151uxuOLgsxHDravuN_9k_whn8imC-0dg) </br>
For this part CPU runtime is sufficient.
